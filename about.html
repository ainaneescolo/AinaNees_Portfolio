				<h3>Hi,</h3>
				<p>
					Throughout my academic journey, I explored diverse fields, including Graphic Design and Web Programming, 
					which gave me knowledge of image, composition and design that I have later been able to transfer to the world of video games. 
					I also have traineeship experience since I completed an internship at a book publisher and currently, I'm engaged in an internship
					in a Geospatial Intelligence and Urban-Rural Computing company, named Space4Earth, where I program with GIS. Additionally, 
					I pursued personal projects to acquire proficiency in Python. <br>
					<br>
					All these experiences have made my preference for video game programming became stronger.
					I hope to keep pushing and improving myself as a programmer and as a person. My goal is to excel not only in technical skills and 
					theoretical knowledge but also to develop strong soft skills like effective communication and leadership. This way, I hope to eventually 
					contribute to the development of the biggest games in the industry.
				</p>
